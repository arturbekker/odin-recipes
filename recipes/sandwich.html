    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A simple sandwich that can be made in 5-10 minutes, my usual go to for a quick meal. All you need is any sort of bread, any sort of cheese, any sort of meat (ideally multiple kinds if possible), and maybe some vegetables if you're into that sort of thing. Additionally, a panini press or George Foreman grill of some sort is required.</p>
    <p>This recipe will be the current variation I am about to make myself right now, but it can be customized any way you like.</p>
